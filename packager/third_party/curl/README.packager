Description:
libcurl is a free and easy-to-use client-side URL transfer library. libcurl
supports SSL certificates, HTTP GET, HTTP POST, HTTP PUT, and various other
transfer protocols.

**************************************************************************
Description of source tree.

1) config/
    Directory containing configuration files, which are required to build
    libcurl and curl correctly. On linux platform, an *auto-generated*
    configuration file "config/linux/curl_config.h" is used; the library uses
    the configuration files coming with libcurl distribution
    "source/lib/config-*.h" on other platforms.

    config/curl/curlbuild.h
        Curl build file renamed from source/include/curl/curlbuild.h.dist

    config/dummy_tool_hugehelp.c
        A dummy manual required to build curl command line tool.

    config/linux/curl_config.h
        An *auto-generated* configuration file by running bash commands:

          cd source
          ./buildconf
          cd ..
          source/configure --with-ssl --without-ca-bundle --without-ca-path \
          --without-zlib --without-libidn --without-librtmp
          cp lib/curl_config.h config/linux/curl_config.h

        on linux platform, with a few features disabled to build correctly on a
        fresh linux box.

    config/mac/curl_config.h
        Similar as above, but run in Mac instead.

    config/linux/find_curl_ca_bundle.sh
        A script used to find the path to curl_ca_bundle in the target system.

2) curl.gyp
    A gyp build file for the library. Manually maintained.

3) source/
    Directory containing curl source codes from github without modification.
