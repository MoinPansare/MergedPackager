00:00:03.837 --> 00:00:07.299
Captain's log, stardate 41636.9.

2
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:11.845
As feared, our examination of the
overdue Federation freighter Odin,

3
00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:16.475
disabled by an asteroid collision,
revealed no life signs.

4
00:00:16.642 --> 00:00:19.019
However three escape pods
were missing,

5
00:00:19.186 --> 00:00:21.939
suggesting
the possibility of survivors.

6
00:00:22.606 --> 00:00:27.861
- Ready to orbit Angel One.
- What kind of place is this, Data?

7
00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:31.615
A Class-M planet supporting
carbon-based flora and fauna,

8
00:00:31.782 --> 00:00:34.326
sparsely populated
with intelligent life.

9
00:00:34.493 --> 00:00:38.497
Similar in technological development
to mid-20th century Earth.

10
00:00:38.664 --> 00:00:41.000
Kinda like being marooned at home.

11
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:43.586
Assuming any survivors
made it this far.

12
00:00:43.794 --> 00:00:49.174
It is the closest planet, but to
go the distance we did in two days,

13
00:00:49.341 --> 00:00:52.344
would've taken the Odin escape pod
five months.

14
00:00:52.511 --> 00:00:54.680
Five months, six days, 11 hours,
two min...

15
00:00:54.847 --> 00:00:58.392
- Thank you, Data.
- ...and 57 seconds.

16
00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.353
Receiving an audio signal
from Angel One.
